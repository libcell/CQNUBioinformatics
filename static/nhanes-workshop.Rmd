# Overview


This workshop was presented at OHSU on June 24, 2016. The same dataset and plots were made for a [parallel breakout session using Python](https://github.com/abalter/data-viz-jamboree).




## Dataset and inspiration

For this workshop, we'll recreate the graphics presented in this article:

[Graphics and statistics for cardiology: comparing categorical and continuous variables](http://heart.bmj.com/content/early/2016/01/27/heartjnl-2015-308104.full) 

* _Authors:_ Kenneth Rice, Thomas Lumley  
* [Full text](http://faculty.washington.edu/kenrice/heartgraphs/effectivegraphs.pdf)
* [Datasets used](http://faculty.washington.edu/kenrice/heartgraphs/)
    - The links to the medium and large datasets may be wrong- remove the second "s" in the urls
    - Datasets are also in our github repo for this workshop
* Data derived from [NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/)
* [Additional materials](http://faculty.washington.edu/kenrice/heartgraphs/)
   

Sometimes we'll offer a challenge for you to try on your own (either during or after this workshop), which will look like this:

<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-heading"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> If this was easy:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Try this!
  </div>
</div>

Other times, we'll encourage you to pair up with a partner to solve a problem, which will look like this:

<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading"><i class="fa fa-handshake-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Pair up</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Work together on this!
  </div>
</div>



# Pre-work

Your pre-work included:

* Install R
* Install RStudio
* Install the packages listed below, and load them in your current work session
* Importing the dataset into your current work session



## Install packages 

Do this once per machine.

```{r install_packages_demo, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("ggbeeswarm") 
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("hexbin")
install.packages("ggalt")
```

## Load packages 

Do this once per R session.

```{r load_packages_demo, eval = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(dplyr)
library(MASS)
library(hexbin)
library(ggalt)
```

## Import data 

Use the `readr` package to import the nhanes_large.csv with the `read_csv` function.

* The first argument in the `read_csv()` parentheses is the url to the dataset
* The second argument, `na = "."`, specifies that missing data in this dataset is denoted by a period
* Finally, assign the data to an R object using `<-` and call that object something simple, like `heart`.


```{r nhanes}
heart <- read_csv("http://faculty.washington.edu/kenrice/heartgraphs/nhaneslarge.csv", na = ".") 
```





# Basics

## HLO

It is good practice to say HLO to your new dataset by doing a High-Level Overview using some built-in R functions. 

Use the `head()` function in your console and check with your partner to see if you got the same output. How many rows of data do you see? 

```{r head, eval=FALSE}
head(heart)
```


<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-heading"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> If this was easy:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Type `?head` in your console and figure out how to reveal the first 10 rows. Search online to find out the R function that returns the **last** *n* rows of a dataframe.
  </div>
</div>

Let's look at the variables in our `heart` dataframe:

```{r variables}
names(heart)
```

You may be wondering what `DR1TFOLA` and `BPXSAR` are. The [data dictionary online](http://faculty.washington.edu/kenrice/heartgraphs/) defines the variable names as follows:

* `BPXSAR`: systolic blood pressure (mmHg)
* `BPXDAR`: diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
* `BPXDI1`, `BPXDI2`: two diastolic blood pressure readings
* `race_ethc`: race/ethnicity, coded as Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic and Other
* `gender`: sex, coded as Male/Female
* `DR1TFOLA`: folate intake (Î¼g/day)
* `RIAGENDR`: sex, coded as 1/2
* `BMXBMI`: body mass index (kg/m2)
* `RIDAGEY`: age (years)

## All functions have arguments

We just used 2 different *functions* in R: `head()` and `names()`. All functions take *arguments*, which typically go inside parentheses. Order matters here, unless you explicitly label the arguments; for example:

```{r nhanes2, eval = FALSE}
head(6, heart) # this will not work
head(n = 6, x = heart) # this works, but you type more
head(heart, 6) # this works and is succinct
```

For both `head()` and `names()`, the first argument was our dataframe, which we named `heart`. `ggplot2` is a package that essentially contains a bunch of functions, each taking different arguments, which we'll explore now...





# Graphs for display of single samples

Let's focus first on univariate plots by examining folate intake (a continuous variable). The first function we need is `ggplot()`: this function initializes a new ggplot object.

We'll start with 1 argument: your dataframe- we called ours `heart`. 


```{r empty_plot}
ggplot(heart) 
```

The code above should produce an empty plot (a gray rectangle). 

`ggplot` makes a plot by layering. So let's take this empty plot and add a layer to it. This layer is a geometric object, or `geom` for short. Let's start with the `geom_histogram()`. 

Each `geom` also takes arguments, and you can always find out what arguments go along with a specific geom using the help function in the console:

```{r help, eval = FALSE}
?geom_histogram
```

## Histograms

We'll take that empty plot and add a `geom_histogram()` layer using the `+` sign. This geom requires at least one argument, and it is special: it is an aesthestic mapping (`aes()`), meaning that what goes in the parentheses here *must* be a variable that is in our dataframe. Here, we map folate intake onto the x-axis.

```{r hist1}
ggplot(heart) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = DR1TFOLA))
```


*Small tweak #1:* change colour outline of bars

One of the arguments that `geom_histogram()` takes is `colour`- we'll change it to white. Note that we are *outside* of the `aes()`- this is because the color "white" is not a variable.

```{r hist2}
ggplot(heart) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = DR1TFOLA), colour = "white") 
```

*Small tweak #2:* change colour fill of bars

You might be surprised to see that `colour` does not in fact relate to the colour *inside* the bars (see above). To change that, we use another argument for `geom_histogram()`- `fill`. How `colour` versus `fill` works depends on which `geom` you are using. For our histogram, we'll change the the colour inside to orchid.

```{r hist3}
ggplot(heart) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = DR1TFOLA), fill = "orchid")
```


<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-heading"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> If this was easy:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Make a histogram with `royalblue` bars and a `hotpink` outline.
```{r hist4, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(heart) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = DR1TFOLA), colour = "hotpink", fill = "royalblue")
```
  </div>
</div>

*Small tweak #3:* change number of bins

You may have noticed that all of our histograms have printed this warning in your console:

`#stat_bin() using bins = 30. Pick better value with binwidth.`

This warning tells us that `bins = 30` is the default that `ggplot` chose for us, based on our data. Let's play around with this!

<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading"><i class="fa fa-handshake-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Pair up</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Make a histogram with 10 bins, and one with 50 bins. Color/fill any way you like!
```{r hist6, include = FALSE}
ggplot(heart) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = DR1TFOLA), 
                 colour = "white", 
                 fill = "orchid", 
                 bins = 50) 
```
  </div>
</div>



*Small tweak #3:* update x-axis title 

This is done by adding a `labs` layer, short for labels. We want to relabel the x-axis. Let's also save our `ggplot` object now, and call it `myhist`.

```{r hist5}
myhist <- ggplot(heart, aes(x = DR1TFOLA)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "white", fill = "orchid") +
  labs(x = "folate intake")
```






I'm pretty happy with this one, so I'm going to save this plot so I can stop typing the same thing over and over again, and I can add layers using this one as my base plot.

```{r hist_save, fig.show="hide"}
hist <- ggplot(heart, aes(x = DR1TFOLA)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "white", fill = "orchid", bins = 50) +
  labs(x = "folate intake (Î¼g/day)")
hist # view your plot
```

# Graphs comparing two variables: continuous vs. categorical

OK, let's add another variable to the mix. We'll keep looking at folate intake as the continuous variable, with `gender` as the categorical variable. There are a few ways to do this in `ggplot2`. 

* Facets
* Colors
* Side-by-side plots (along the x-axis)


## Facets

About facets (from `facet_wrap` documentation):

> "Most displays are roughly rectangular, so if you have a categorical variable with many levels, it doesn't make sense to try and display them all in one row (or one column). To solve this dilemma, facet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d, making best use of screen real estate."

Let's add `+ facet_wrap(~variable)` to split the histograms based on `gender`

```{r hist_facet}
hist + facet_wrap(~gender)
```

Just as a reminder, the below code would create the exact same plot- just with more repetitive typing.

```{r hist_facet_compare, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(heart, aes(x = DR1TFOLA)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "white", fill = "orchid", bins = 50) +
  labs(x = "folate intake (Î¼g/day)") +
  facet_wrap(~gender)
```


<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">If this was easy:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Make the same facetted plot using the kernel density geom (`geom_density`) instead of `geom_histogram`.
```{r dens_facet, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(heart, aes(x = DR1TFOLA)) +
  geom_density(colour = "white", fill = "orchid") +
  labs(x = "folate intake (Î¼g/day)") +
  facet_wrap(~gender)
```
  </div>
</div>


## Colours

So far, when we played with colours, we set fill/colour without mapping them onto another variable (i.e., `(colour = "white", fill = "orchid")`). Now, we want fill/colour to **vary** based on the value of a specific variable. Here we want colour to depend on `gender`, so we map the colour aesthetic (`aes(colour = variable)`) onto the variable `gender`.

Notice moving the colour into aesthetics parentheses.

```{r dens1}
ggplot(heart, aes(x = DR1TFOLA)) +
  geom_density(aes(colour = gender)) +
  labs(x = "folate intake (Î¼g/day)") 
```

The below code will produce the *exact* same plot. Try it! I promise it is identical. Play around with changing global aesthetics (like below) versus geom-specific aesthetics (like above). It won't matter when you only have one layer, but once you start adding `geoms` and `stats`, this can be a powerful way to change your visualization.

```{r dens2, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(heart, aes(x = DR1TFOLA, colour = gender)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(x = "folate intake (Î¼g/day)") 
```

## Side-by-side plots

Now let's make some side-by-side univariate plots, specifically dotcharts or stripcharts, to visualize systolic blood pressure by gender. We'll start with a new base plot, and save it to an object called `side` that we can then add geoms to.

```{r side}
side <- ggplot(heart, aes(x = gender, y = BPXSAR)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)")
```

<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading"><i class="fa fa-handshake-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Pair up</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
If you type `side` into your console, what will the plot look like? Try adding a `geom_point()`- is this plot useful?
```{r point1, include = FALSE}
side # blank plot
side + geom_point() 
```
  </div>
</div>


Let's take this plot and tweak it a bit. 

*Small tweak #2:* make points more transparent

Alpha works on a scale from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque).
 
```{r point2}
side + geom_point(alpha = .3) 
```

*Small tweak #3*: try jittering the points

To do this, instead of `geom_point()`, we will switch to using `geom_jitter()`, which automatically adds both vertical and horizontal space (noise) to your datapoints.

```{r jitter1}
side + geom_jitter(alpha = .3) 
```

*Small tweak #4*: control the jitter

Sometimes you may only want to change the width of jitter but not the height. 

```{r jitter2}
side + geom_jitter(alpha = .3, width = .2, height = 0) 
```


Now let's try a different geom in our side-by-side plot, which is available through the `beeswarm` package you already loaded.


```{r bee1}
side + geom_beeswarm() 
```

*Small tweak #1:* add alpha again

```{r bee2}
side + geom_beeswarm(alpha = .2) 
```

*Small tweak #2:* add statistics

We'll include the mean plus 95% CI

```{r bee_stats}
ggplot(heart, aes(x = gender, y = BPXSAR)) +
  geom_beeswarm(alpha = .2) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom = "point", colour = "orange") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = "linerange", colour = "orange")  +
  labs(x = "", y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)")
```

*Small tweak #3:* add another geom layer

Try adding `geom_boxplot` on top of your side-by-side beeswarm plot. Also try re-ordering the geoms to see what changes.

```{r bee_box}
side +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_beeswarm(alpha = .2) 
```


New geom time- this time use `geom_violin`.

```{r vio1}
side + geom_violin(alpha = .2) 
```

*Small tweak #1:* add statistics

Let's include the sample mean and median

```{r vio_stat}
ggplot(heart, aes(x = gender, y = BPXSAR)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = .2) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom = "point", colour = "orange") +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "median", geom = "point", colour = "blue") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)")
```

*Small tweak #2:* add another geom layer

Add another layer to your violin plot: try `geom_boxplot`

```{r vio_box}
side +
  geom_violin(alpha = .2) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .05) 
```

# Graphs comparing two variables: continuous vs. continuous

Now we'll create some bivariate plots to look at the association between age and systolic blood pressure, both of which are continuous variables.

## Scatterplots

```{r scatter1}
ggplot(heart, aes(x = RIDAGEYR, y = BPXSAR)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age (years)", y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)")
```

If you have big n, try hexbin plot
```{r hex1}
ggplot(heart, aes(x = RIDAGEYR, y = BPXSAR)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(x = "Age (years)", y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)")
```

Make colors make more sense
```{r hex2}
library(viridis)
ggplot(heart, aes(x = RIDAGEYR, y = BPXSAR)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(x = "Age (years)", y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = viridis(256, begin = 1, end = 0))
```


```{r contour}
library(ggalt)
ggplot(heart, aes(x = RIDAGEYR, y = BPXSAR)) +
  stat_bkde2d(aes(fill = ..level.., alpha = ..level..), geom = "polygon", bandwidth = c(2,2))  +
  labs(x = "Age (years)", y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = viridis(256, begin = 1, end = 0))
```

Add linear regression line with SE
```{r scatter_lm}
ggplot(heart, aes(x = RIDAGEYR, y = BPXSAR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Age (years)", y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)")
```

Default is loess line
```{r scatter_loess}
ggplot(heart, aes(x = RIDAGEYR, y = BPXSAR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Age (years)", y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)")
```

Add splines
```{r scatter_splines}
library(splines)
library(MASS)
ggplot(heart, aes(x = RIDAGEYR, y = BPXSAR)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ ns(x, 3)) +
  labs(x = "Age (years)", y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)")
```

# Graphs illustrating more than two variables

We'll finish up by creating some multivariable plots that help us visualize how the association between body mass index & systolic BP varies by gender and age (so 4 variables!).

Just copy this code to create a categorical age variable:
```{r create_age_category}
library(dplyr)
heart2 <- heart %>% 
  mutate(age_cat = cut(RIDAGEYR, c(0, 30, 55, 100)))
```

Recreate theirs first

```{r multi_facet}
ggplot(heart2, aes(x = BMXBMI, y = BPXSAR)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(aes(colour = gender), method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~age_cat) +
  labs(x = "Body Mass Index"~(kg/m^2), y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)")
```

Try with facet grid, update labels

```{r multi_grid1}
grid <- ggplot(heart2, aes(x = BMXBMI, y = BPXSAR)) +
  stat_smooth(aes(colour = gender), method = "lm") +
  facet_grid(gender~age_cat) +
  labs(x = "Body Mass Index"~(kg/m^2), y = "Systolic BP (mmHg)")
grid + geom_point()
```

Play with colors!
```{r multi_grid2}
grid +
  geom_point(aes(colour = gender), alpha = .5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#B47CC7", "#D65F5F"), guide = FALSE)
```


```{r multi_grid3}
my_colors <- c("#C4AD66", "#77BEDB")
grid +
  theme_light() +
  scale_color_manual(values = my_colors, guide = FALSE)
```
