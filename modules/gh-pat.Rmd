First, install the [`usethis` package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/):

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("usethis")
```

Then load it to use it:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(usethis)
```

Now, follow the instructions from [Happy Git with R for setting up a GitHub personal access token or PAT](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html).

:::gotcha
Be sure to restart your R session after setting up the PAT, and pay close attention that your `.Renviron` file has at least one empty line at the bottom.

Once you have a GitHub PAT set up in your `.Renviron` file, you can stay in the comfort of your project in the RStudio IDE to do all the GitHub things we were doing before online in your browser.
