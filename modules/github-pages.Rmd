1. **Back on GitHub, click the *Settings* tab** of your project repository.


2. **Scroll down** until you get to "GitHub Pages" and select "master branch/docs folder". (This is why we had to set up `output_dir: docs` in our `site.yml` file previously. If your file doesn't end up in the `docs/` folder, GitHub pages won't find it.)

4. **Add this url to the repo description** so that it's easy to find.
